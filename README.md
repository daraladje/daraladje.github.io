# d3narr

Prompt:

Create a narrative visualization implemented as an interactive web page, using your knowledge of visual communication and narrative structure, along with your skills at D3 programming in JavaScript.

The narrative visualization should follow one of the three effective narrative visualization structures:

a martini glass, where the message is delivered without allowing user exploration until the end,
an interactive slideshow, where user exploration is allowed at some or all of the steps of the story, or
a drill down story. which presents an overview and allows the user to explore different storylines from there.

The narrative visualization should be built with scenes, annotations, parameters, and triggers.

The scenes should follow a template for visual consistency and follow an order to best convey the message.

The annotations should follow a template for visual consistency from scene to scene. These annotations should also highlight and reinforce specific data items or trends that make the important points for the desired messaging of the narrative visualization.

The parameters are the state variables of your narrative visualization. Your narrative visualization should use these parameters to control the construction of scenes.

The triggers connect user interface actions to changes in parameters that change the state of the narrative visualization.

The data: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing

The Narrative: Donald Trump claims that we have more cases because we have more testing. I want to show that relatively, even though we have more tests, this is not the driver behind more cases.

Written Portion (I can complete this part, but to keep in mind):

The essay should contain the following sections.

Messaging. What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

Narrative Structure. Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)

Visual Structure. What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene?

Scenes. What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why

Annotations. What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging?

Parameters. What are the parameters of the narrative visualization?

Triggers. What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?
